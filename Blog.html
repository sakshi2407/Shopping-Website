                        <h4>Guide to Shopping Spring Trends in 2022
                        </h4>



                        <span class="more">
                            The sun is out, hemlines are rising, and bright, bold colors are dominating the streets. It
                            can mean only one thing: Spring 2022 fashion trends are finally here. Time to pack up gray
                            knits and tuck away those wool trousers—the clothing that will carry you through the spring
                            2022 season has an upbeat, offbeat quality to it.

                            Seen at runway shows from New York to Tokyo, the trends of spring 2022 embrace vibrancy and
                            joy. At Tory Burch, bold stripes in black and white—some cut with a flash of grassy
                            green—signaled a new quirky order. Prada and Chanel put swimsuits and short-shorts on the
                            catwalk, proving that beachwear can be ready-to-wear, while Marine Serre and Dries Van Noten
                            revived the popcorn tops of the ’90s to bring some fun into our closets.

                        <span class="more">
                            When the days are long and the heat is rising, a wardrobe of crisp, cool whites is the
                            perfect refreshment. Whether you’re by the beach or pounding the city streets, an all-white
                            outfit solves a few key problems: you don’t have to think too much about coordinating the
                            various components of your look and even if you break a sweat, you’ll still look put
                            together.An all-white outfit provides a clean aesthetic that can be casual as a coordinated
                            lounge set or elevated with a mixture of textures. Even with a minimalist, monochromatic
                            palette, you’ll find endlessly creative ways to wear the colour across occasions, price
                            points, and style sensibilities.With summer in full swing, there’s no better time to invest
                            in hot weather staples.

                        <span class="more">
                            Our love of the comfy sandal is showing no signs of slowing down. Spotted on the runways of
                            Chloe and Stella McCartney, sporty sandals are once again stealing the limelight and who are
                            we to complain when this shoe trend is both fashionable and functional?
                            "The athleisure trend lives on and sporty sandals are set to be popular this Spring, as seen
                            across the Spring/Summer catwalks of Hermes and Chloe. Chunky soles are key and combined
                            with super comfortable neoprene fabric and functional velcro straps, these sandals epitomize
                            our want for both style and comfort," says Eastwood.
                            Incredibly versatile, there are no rules when it comes to wearing your sporty sandals. Try
                            teaming a colorful pair with your favorite denim or keep it chic in sleek neutrals and
                            tailored trousers. These comfortable flats are a worthy addition to your spring capsule
                            wardrobe, the possibilities are endless.

                        <span class="more">
                            Peak sunglasses season is upon us and the time is ripe to be updating your collection with
                            the best frames of seasons past and present. Whether you're a serial sunglasses wearer à la
                            Anna Wintour or you're simply looking for a pair to elevate days out, spent in parks and pub
                            gardens, there's no shortage of stylish shades.Whatever style you choose (classic shapes are
                            good too) it’s not always easy picking a new pair of sunglasses, especially with the
                            opportunity to try them on in-store being sometimes limited. Pile that on top of the breadth
                            of choice in lens strengths, colours and polarisation (glare protection) options, and it can
                            all become rather baffling.

                        <h4>THE WATCH TRENDS YOU NEED TO KNOW RIGHT NOW</h4>

                        <span class="more">
                            Watch brands don’t like to think that they are affected by the whimsies of fashion, but
                            whether it is a result of the hive mind or because timepieces are just as much an accessory
                            as a new bag, every year certain styles end up being more popular than others.

                            If you’re looking to use the change of seasons as a reason to invest in a new wrist
                            adornment; save yourself from strapping on a dud by taking a look at our pick of the the top
                            watch trends that have emerged in recent months.
                            If ever there was proof that watches and fashion follow a similar path, it’s this season’s
                            line-up of retro reissues. One man’s bum bag is another man’s Bremont. “Vintage- and
                            heritage-inspired timepieces and smaller case sizes continue to prevail,” says Simon
                            Spiteri, accessories buyer at Mr Porter. “It is a style that makes for a subtle extension to
                            a guy’s outfit while being practical and functional in use.”
